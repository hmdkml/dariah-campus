summary:
  content: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
    insights into the use of "topical vocabularies" and their use in metadata
    curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in
    the EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better
    understanding of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH
    branch of the EOSC, and be familiar with some initiatives related to
    metadata curation and enrichment in the SSH.
