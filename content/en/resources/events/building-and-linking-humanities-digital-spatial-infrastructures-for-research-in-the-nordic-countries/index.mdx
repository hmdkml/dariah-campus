  title: Building and Linking Humanities' Digital Spatial Infrastructures
  content: This workshop, focussing on "Spatial data medieval to modern", is the
    first of a series of workshops from the NOS-HS project "Linking, Building,
    and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial Infrastructures for Research in
    the Nordic Countries".  The main aims of this workshop were to define key
    concepts (spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data, metadata, ontology),
    outline major challenges in the field, and to provide an opportunity to
    share experiences of addressing the issues in individual and national
    projects across the Nordic countries.

This workshop covers key concepts in the field of (spatial) digital research infrastructures in the Humanities such as spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data (LOD), metadata, ontology etc. It also outlines major challenges in the field and gives some concrete, authentic examples of how to overcome them in small and large-scale projects in both academia and the GLAM sector.
