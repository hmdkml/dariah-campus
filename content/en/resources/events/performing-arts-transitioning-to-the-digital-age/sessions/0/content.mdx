The workshop is aimed at performing artists, especially theatre actors and theatre audiences. It includes testing the prototype of the digital tool "e-spect\@tor" and the performance of the hybrid play #WAR\_DIARY, whose authors are actors from the Ukrainian Centre for Contemporary Art DAKH in Kyiv and the international Ukrainian festival Gogolfest. Croatian actors, participants of the workshop, worked on a textual template of the play, exploring the ways in which the Zoom platform can be used as a tool to enrich their performance.
