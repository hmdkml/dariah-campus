Since May 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) has been in force in all European member states. This affects not only the private sector, but also the academic one.

In the course of an academic career, you will most certainly collect and process personal data from third parties - be it in the context of your research or because you are organizing a conference, where you have to collect personal data of the attendees. This makes it especially important - from a legal and an ethical perspective - that the data processing is done in a GDPR-compliant manner.

To help you with this, we would like to introduce you to the most important terms and concepts of the GDPR. We will also show you the ELDAH Consent Form Wizard, a tool that allows you to create GDPR-compliant consent forms for personal data collection in a research context, which you can adapt to your particular research purpose.

## Key terms in the GDPR

In the first part of the video-series, we will take a closer look at some **general information about the GDPR**. We will clarify what the GDPR applies to, **what "data processing" means** in the sense of the GDPR and what **data categories** it actually concerns (keywords: *personal data* and *sensitive data*). We will also get to know **two ways of handling data** that help to increase data protection - *anonymization* and *pseudonymization* of data.

## Principles, rights and obligations laid out in the GDPR

In this part of the video-series we will look at **7 "principles"** which allow for - and are **obligatory** for - the processing of personal data according to the GDPR and will learn what each of these principles mean. Furthermore, we will look at **key roles** in the data processing context addressed in the GDPR and their **rights and obligations**. *<DownloadLink href="images/data-protection-in-research-practice-ii-principles-rights-and-responsibilities.pptx" title="(Click here to download the slides used in the video) " />*

## The GDPR in Science and Research

Now that the first two videos have clarified the most important terms and concepts, we will focus in this part on the **impact of the GDPR on science and research,** and we will also learn about the **exemptions** created in the GDPR in the context of **public archiving and research**. *<DownloadLink href="images/data-protection-in-research-practice-iii-the-gdpr-in-science-and-research-.pptx" title="(Click here to download the slides used in the video)" />*
