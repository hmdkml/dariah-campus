summary:
  content: Topic modelling is a technique by which documents within a corpus are
    clustered based on how certain groups of terms are used together within the
    text.  The commonalities between such term groupings tend to form what we
    would normally call “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise
    documents by their structural content, rather than a more metadata-based
    knowledge system.  Using resources held with EHRI's collections, this
    notebook offers learners an introduction to 'LDA' topic modelling using
    Python in a step-by-step guide.

Topic modelling is a machine-learning technique that finds patterns in language use within a corpus of documents, and clusters those documents accordingly.   The commonalities in ther patterns form “topics”, providing a way to automatically categorise documents by their structural content. The specific type of topic modelling covered in this resource is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation - 'LDA'.

This EHRI notebook walks readers through the process of topic modelling transcripts obtained through the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) (USHMM) using Python and accompanies the article published in the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) Document Blog entitled "Exploratory Topic Modelling in Python".

## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

* Understand the basic concepts of topic modelling
* Walk through the process of topic modelling in Python.
